    "Welcome to network-wide anomaly detection homework - This homework implements the algorithms described in the paper of \"Network-Wide Anomaly Event Detection and Diagnosis With perfSONAR\". In the homework 3.2, we will learn the second part of this paper, PCA-APD for network-wide performance detection to detect corrlected anomalies in the multiple measurement traces. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In this homework, you will learn:**\n",
    "- The basic theory and dimension reduction and how to use Principal component analysis (PCA) and Singular value decomposition (SVD)  algorithms for dimension reduction;\n",
    "- The idea of using dimension reduction to separate correlated anomalies and uncorrelated anomalies from multiple measurements traces.\n",
    "- How to combine SVD and our APD algorithm for correlated and uncorrelated anomalies detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In homework 3.1, you have learned APD agorithm to detected anomalies in single trace. In this homework, you will learn how to SVD and APD algorithm to detect anomalies in multiple traces. More specificly, we need to detect correlated anomalies and correlated anomalies in multiple traces. Correlated anomalies are anomalies occurred at same time in different traces, which are more important than uncorrelated anomalies. \n",
