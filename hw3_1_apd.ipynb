    "Anomaly detection is to find outlier in time series data. There are plenty of anomaly types, such as unexpected spikes, drops, trend changes and level shifts. It's widely used in health monitoring, fault detection in business, event detection in sensor networks, and performance detection in computer networks. In this homework, we will focus on the anomlay detection for network performance using time-series datasets.\n",

    "**In howework 3.1, you will learn how to:**\n",
